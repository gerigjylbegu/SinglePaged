My name is Geri Gjylbegu and I live in Vlore,Albania.
I am going to show you everything about your linux computer.
So If you don't have a linux download one because it is better than a windows.
I promise you that you won't change your mind anymore.
Here are some versions you will need:
 
 -[linux mint 13/17/17.1](http://www.linuxmint.com/download_all.php)
 
 -[ubuntu 14.04 or 14.10](http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/ubuntu-14.04.1-desktop-i386.iso)
 
 -[pear os 8](http://download2us.softpedia.com/dl/8e10168805c6528e45b7f3fedff06cad/54a3cb46/500076309/linux/pearos8-i386.iso)
 
 -[elementary os](http://heanet.dl.sourceforge.net/project/elementaryos/stable/elementaryos-stable-i386.20130810.iso) 
 
 -[xubuntu 14.04(not recomanded)](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/14.04/release/xubuntu-14.04.1-desktop-i386.iso)
 
These are the lastest versions of linux which works nearly in the same way.
