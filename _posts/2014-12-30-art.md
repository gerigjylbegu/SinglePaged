My name is Geri Gjylbegu and I live in Vlore,Albania.
I am going to show you everything you want about your linux computer.
So If you don't have a linux download one because it is better than a windows.
I promise you that you won't change your mind anymore.
Here are some versions you will need:
 
 -[Linux mint 13/17/17.1](http://www.linuxmint.com/download_all.php)
 
 -[Pear os 8](http://download2us.softpedia.com/dl/8e10168805c6528e45b7f3fedff06cad/54a3cb46/500076309/linux/pearos8-i386.iso)
 
 -[Elementary os](http://elementary.io/) 
 
 -[Ubuntu 14.04(not recomanded for 32-bit)](http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/)

 -[Chromixium](http://chromixium.org) 

 -[Ubuntu 15.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/15.04/)

These are the lastest versions of linux which works nearly in the same way.
